    "For a typical heavy-fluxonium qubit, the frequency of the transition between the first two energy levels is small in comparison to the temperature of the bath. Thus the qubit relaxes to a mixed state, in contrast to higher-frequency transmon qubits which typically relax to the ground state. The coupling to a low-Q resonator provides the non-unitary process needed to remove entropy from this state.\n",

The first four levels of the fluxonium are labeled with $g,e,f,h$ respectively, and the resonator Fock states are labeled with numbers. The transitions $|g0\\rangle$ to $|h0\\rangle$ and $|h0\\rangle$ to $|e1\\rangle$ are driven simulataneously for a period of 15 $\\mu$ s. Throughout this process, photon loss in the resonator causes the population of $|e1\\rangle$ to transition to $|e0\\rangle$. The system eventually reaches a steady state, preparing $|e0\\rangle$ with high fidelity.\n",

    "1) The first truncation is controlled by setting the `truncated_dim` parameter in the subsystem initialization, which determines the dimension used in diagonalizing the Hamiltonian. Setting these too low can result in an unphysical simulation. Even if energy levels above the truncation are not explicitly involved, they can still drastically affect the matrix elements of the operators. \n",

However, this results in a full Hamiltonian represented by an $80 \\times 80$ matrix. After diagonalization, the Hamiltonian and subsystem operators can be safely truncated to a lower dimension, specified here by the variable `total_truncation`."
